# EasyHarmony

A simple web app that uses JavaScript to calculate the notes in a musical chord, scale, and inverted harmony chords.

## How to Use

Simply open up the application, input a root note, follow the instructions for the other inputs, and then click calculate.

## Motivation

Several friends asked me to teach them music theory, and so I made them this basic application to help them in their playing.
